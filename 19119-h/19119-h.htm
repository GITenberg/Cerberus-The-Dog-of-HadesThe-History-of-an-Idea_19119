<h3>Explanation of Frontispiece</h3>

<p>The picture is reproduced from Baumeister's <i>Denkm&auml;ler des klassichen
Alterthums</i>, volume I., figure 730 (text on p. 663). It is on a vase and
describes one of the twelve heroic deeds of Herakles. The latter,
holding aloft his club, drags two-headed Cerberus out of Hades by a
chain drawn through the jaw of one of his heads. He is just about to
pass Cerberus through a portal indicated by an Ionic pillar. To the
right Persephone, stepping out of her palace, seems to forbid the rape.
Herakles in his turn seems to threaten the goddess, while Hermes, to the
left, holds a protecting or restraining arm over him. Athene, with
averted face, ready to depart with her prot&eacute;g&eacute;, stands in front of four
horses hitched to her chariot. Upon her shield the eagle augurs the
success of the entire undertaking.</p>

<h2>CERBERUS, THE DOG OF HADES</h2>


<p>Hermes, the guide of the dead, brings to Pluto's kingdom their psyches,
"that gibber like bats, as they fare down the dank ways, past the
streams of Okeanos, past the gates of the sun and the land of dreams, to
the meadow of asphodel in the dark realm of Hades, where dwell the
souls, the phantoms of men outworn." So begins the twenty-fourth book of
the <i>Odyssey</i>. Later poets have Charon, a grim boatsman, receive the
dead at the River of Woe; he ferries them across, provided the passage
money has been placed in their mouths, and their bodies have been duly
buried in the world above. Otherwise they are left to gibber on the
hither bank. Pluto's house, wide-gated, thronged with guests, has a
janitor Kerberos, sometimes friendly, sometimes snarling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg&nbsp;2]</a></span> when new
guests arrive, but always hostile to those who would depart. Honey cakes
are provided for them that are about to go to Hades&mdash;the sop to
Cerberus. This dog, nameless and undescribed, Homer mentions simply as
the dog of Hades, whom Herakles, as the last and chief test of his
strength, snatched from the horrible house of Hades.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> First Hesiod and
next Stesichorus discover his name to be Kerberos. The latter seems to
have composed a poem on the dog. Hesiod<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> mentions not only the name
but also the genealogy of Kerberos. Of Typhaon and Echidna he was born,
the irresistible and ineffable flesh-devourer, the voracious,
brazen-voiced, fifty-headed dog of hell.</p>

<p>Plato in the <i>Republic</i> refers to the composite nature of Kerberos.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Not until Apollodorus (2. 5. 12. 1. ff.), in the second century B. C.,
comes the familiar description: Kerberos now has three dog heads, a
dragon tail, and his back is covered with the heads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg&nbsp;3]</a></span> of serpents. But
his plural heads must have been familiarly assumed by the Greeks; this
will appear from the evidence of their sculptures and vase-paintings.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3>CERBERUS IN CLASSIC ART.</h3>

<p>Classic art has taken up Cerberus very generously; his treatment,
however, is far from being as definite as that of the Greek and Roman
poets. Statues, sarcophagi, and vase paintings whose theme is Hades, or
scenes laid in Hades, represent him as a ferocious Greek collie, often
encircled with serpents, and with a serpent for a tail, but there is no
certainty as to the number of his heads. Often he is three-headed in art
as in literature, as may be seen conveniently in the reproductions in
Baumeister's <i>Denkm&auml;ler des Klassischen Altertums</i>. Very familiar is the
statue in the villa Borghese of Pluto enthroned, three-headed Cerberus
by his side.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> A Greek scarab&aelig;us shows a pair of lovers, or a married
couple, who have died<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span> at the same time, crossing in Charon's ferry. As
they are approaching the other bank of the Styx, where a three-headed
Cerberus is awaiting them, the girl seems afright and is upheld by her
male companion.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> On the other hand, a bronze in Naples shows the
smiling boy Herakles engaged in strangling two serpents, one with each
hand. The figure rests on a cylindrical base upon which are depicted
eight of the wonderful deeds which Herakles performs later on. By a rope
he leads a <i>two-headed</i> Cerberus from Hades.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>This last of the wonderful deeds of Herakles is a favorite theme of vase
pictures. Herakles is regularly accompanied by Hermes and Athena; the
dog, whose marvelous shape Homer fails to reveal, is generally
two-headed. Such a vase may be seen in Gerhard, <i>Auserlesene
Vasenbilder</i>, ii. 131.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Or still more conveniently, Professor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span> Norton
has reproduced<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> an amphora in the Louvre with a picture of the
dicephalous Kerberos. Upon the forehead of each of the two heads rises a
serpent. Herakles in tunic and lion's skin, armed with bow, quiver, and
sword, stoops towards the dog. He holds a chain in his left hand, while
he stretches out his right with a petting gesture. Between the two is a
tree, against which leans the club of Herakles. Behind him stands
Athena.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3>CERBERUS IN ROMAN AND MODERN LITERATURE.</h3>

<p>Neither Greek literature, nor Greek art, however, really seems to fix
either the shape or nature of Kerberos; it was left to the Roman poets
to say the last word about him. They finally settle the number of his
heads, or the number of his bodies fused in one. He is <i>triceps</i>
"three-headed," <i>triplex</i> or <i>tergeminus</i> "threefold," <i>triformis</i> "of
three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span> bodies," or simply Tricerberus. Tibullus says explicitly that he
has both three heads and three tongues: <i>cui tres sint lingu&aelig;
tergeminumque caput</i>. Virgil, in the <i>&AElig;neid</i>, vi. 417, has huge Cerberus
barking with triple jaws; his neck bristles with serpents. Ovid in his
<i>Metamorphoses</i>, x. 21, makes Orpheus, looking for dear Eurydice in
Tartarus, declare that he did not go down in order that he might chain
the three necks, shaggy with serpents, of the monster begotten of
Medusa. His business also is settled for all time; he is the terrible,
fearless, and watchful janitor, or guardian (<i>janitor</i> or <i>custos</i>) of
Orcus, the Styx, Lethe, or the black Kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And so he remains for
modern poets, as when Dante, reproducing Virgil, describes him:<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"When Cerberus, that great worm, had seen us</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His mouth he opened and his fangs were shown,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then my leader with his folded palms</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Took of the earth, and filling full his hand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into those hungry gullets flung it down."</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span></p><p>Or Shakespeare, <i>Love's Labor Lost</i>, v. ii: "Great Hercules is presented
by this imp whose club killed Cerberus, the three-headed <i>canis</i>."</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3>CLASSICAL EXPLANATIONS OF CERBERUS.</h3>

<p>Such classical explanations of Cerberus' shape as I have seen are feeble
and foolishly reasonable. Heraclitus, <span title = "Peri apistôn"><b>&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7936;&#960;&#8055;&#963;&#964;&#969;&#957;</b></span> 331, states
that Kerberos had two pups. They always attended their father, and
therefore he appeared to be three-headed. The mythographer
Palaephatos(39) states that Kerberos was considered three-headed from
his name <span title = "Trikarênos"><b>&#932;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#940;&#961;&#951;&#957;&#959;&#962;</b></span> which he obtained from the city Trikarenos
in Phliasia. And a late Roman rationalistic mythographer by the name of
Fulgentius<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> tells us that Petronius defined Cerberus as the lawyer of
Hades, apparently because of his three jaws, or the cumulative glibness
of three tongues. Fulgentius himself has a <i>fabula</i> in which he says
that Cerberus means <i>Creaboros</i>, that is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span> "flesh-eating," and that the
three heads of Cerberus are respectively, infancy, youth, and old age,
through which death has entered the circle of the earth&mdash;<i>per quas
introivit mors in orbem terrarum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3>A MODERN VIEW.</h3>

<h5>
"<i>Lasciate ogni speranza voi ch' entrate</i>"
</h5>

<p>Can we bid this "<i>schwankende Gestalt</i>," this monstrous vision, floating
about upon the filmy photographs of murky Hades, stand still, emerge
into light, and assume clear and reasonable outlines?</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Hence loathed melancholy of Cerberus and blackest Midnight born."</span>
</p>

<p>An American humorist, John Kendrick Bangs, who likes to place his skits
in Hades, steps in "where angels fear to tread," and launches with a
light heart the discussion as to whether Cerberus is one or more dogs.
The city of Cimmeria in Hades, having tried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span> asphalt pavement, which was
found too sloppy for that climate, and Nicholson wood pavement, which
kept taking fire, decides on Belgian blocks. In order to meet the new
expense a dog-tax is imposed. Since Cerberus belongs to Hades as a
whole, the state must pay his tax, and is willing enough to do so&mdash;on
Cerberus as one dog. The city, however, endeavors to collect on three
dogs&mdash;one license for each head. Two infernal coppers, sent to impound
Cerberus, fare not well, one of them being badly chewed up by Cerberus,
the other nabbed bodily and thrown into the Styx. In consequence of this
they obtain damages from the city. The city then decides to bring suit
against the state. The bench consists of Apollyon himself and Judge
Blackstone; Coke appears for the city, Catiline for the state. The first
dog-catcher, called to testify, and asked whether he is familiar with
dogs, replies in the affirmative, adding that he had never got quite so
intimate with one as he got with him.</p>

<p>"With whom?" asks Coke.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span></p><p>"Cerberus," replies the witness.</p>

<p>"Do you consider him to be one dog, two dogs, or three dogs?"</p>

<p>Catiline objects to this question as a leading one, but Coke manages to
get it in under another form: "How many dogs did you see when you saw
Cerberus?"</p>

<p>"Three, anyhow," replies the witness with feeling, "though afterwards I
thought there was a whole bench-show atop of me."</p>

<p>On cross-examination Catiline asks him blandly: "My poor friend, if you
considered Cerberus to be three dogs anyhow, why did you in your
examination a moment since refer to the avalanche of caninity, of which
you so affectingly speak, as him?"</p>

<p>"He is a him," sturdily says the witness. After this Coke, discomfited,
decides to call his second witness: "What is your business?" asks Coke,
after the usual preliminaries.</p>

<p>"I'm out of business. Livin' on my damages."</p>

<p>"What damages?"</p>

<p>"Them I got from the city for injuries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span> did me by that there&mdash;I should
say them there&mdash;dorgs, Cerberus."</p>

<p>And so on. Catiline gains the day for the state by his superior logic;
the city of Cimmeria must content itself with taxes on a single dog. But
the logic of the facts, it will appear, are with the dog-catchers, Judge
Coke, and the city of Cimmeria as against the state of Hades: Cerberus
is more than one dog.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3>FUTURE LIFE IN THE VEDA.</h3>

<p>India is the home of the Cerberus myth in its clearest and fullest
development. In order to appreciate its nature we must bear in mind that
the early Hindu conceptions of a future life are auspicious, and quite
the reverse of sombre. The statements in the Veda about life after death
exclude all notions of hell. The early visions are simple, poetic and
cheerful. The bodies of the dead are burned and their ashes are
consigned to earth. But this is viewed merely as a symbolic act of
preparation&mdash;cooking it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span> called forthright&mdash;for another life of joy.
The righteous forefathers of old who died before, they have found
another good place. Especially Yama, the first mortal, has gone to the
great rivers on high; he has searched out, like a pioneer, the way for
all his descendants: "He went before and found a dwelling which no power
can debar us from. Our fathers of old have traveled the path; it leads
every earth-born mortal thither. There in the midst of the highest
heaven beams unfading light and eternal waters flow; there every wish is
fulfilled on the rich meadows of Yama." Day by day Yama sends forth two
dogs, his messengers, to search out among men those who are to join the
fathers that are having an excellent time in Yama's company.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3>THE TWO DOGS OF YAMA.</h3>

<p>The tenth book of the <i>Rig-Veda</i> contains in hymns 14-18 a collection of
funeral stanzas quite unrivaled for mythological and ethnological
interest in the literature of ancient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span> peoples. In hymn 14 there are
three stanzas (10-12) that deal with the two dogs of Yama. This is the
classical passage, all depends upon its interpretation. They contain
detached statements which take up the idea from different points of
view, that are not easily harmonized as long as the dogs are merely
ordinary canines; they resolve themselves fitly and neatly into a pair
of natural objects, if we follow closely all the ideas which the Hindus
associated with them.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is clear that we are dealing with the conception
of Cerberus. In stanza 10 the two dogs are conceived as ill-disposed
creatures, standing guard to keep the departed souls out of bliss. The
soul on its way to heaven is addressed as follows:</p>

<p>"Run past straightway the two four-eyed dogs, the spotted and (the
dark), the brood of Saram&#257;; enter in among the propitious fathers who
hold high feast with Yama."</p>

<p>A somewhat later text, the book of house-rite of &#256;&ccedil;val&#257;yana, has
the notion of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span> sop to Cerberus: "To the two dogs born in the house
of (Yama) Vivasvant's son, to the dark and the spotted, I have given a
cake; do ye guard me ever on my road!"</p>

<p>The twelfth stanza of the <i>Rig-Veda</i> hymn strikes a somewhat different
note which suggests both good and evil in the character of the two dogs:
"The two brown, broad-nosed messengers of Yama, life-robbing, wander
among men. May they restore to us to-day the auspicious breath of life,
that we may behold the sun." Evidently the part of the Cerberi here is
not in harmony with their function in stanza 10: instead of debarring
men from the abodes of bliss they pick out the dead that are ultimately
destined to boon companionship with Yama. The same idea is expressed
simply and clearly in prayers for long life in the <i>Atharva-Veda</i>: "The
two dogs of Yama, the dark and the spotted, that guard the road (to
heaven), that have been dispatched, shall not (go after) thee! Come
hither, do not long to be away! Do not tarry here with thy mind turned
to a distance." (viii. 1. 9.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span> And again: "Remain here, O man, with thy
soul entire! Do not follow the two messengers of Yama; come to the
abodes of the living." (v. 30. 6.)</p>

<p>These prayers contain the natural, yet under the circumstances rather
paradoxical, desire to live yet a little longer upon the earth in the
light of the sun. Fitfully the mortal Hindu regales himself with
saccharine promises of paradise; in his every-day mood he clings to life
and shrinks with the uneasy sense that his paradise may not materialize,
even if the hope is expressed glibly and fluently. The real craving is
expressed in numberless passages: "May we live a hundred autumns,
surrounded by lusty sons." Homer's Hades has wiped out this
inconsistency, only to substitute another. Odysseus, on returning from
his visit to Hades, exclaims baldly: "Better a swineherd on the surface
of the earth in the light of the sun than king of the shades in Hades."
It is almost adding insult to injury to have the road to such a Hades
barred by Cerberus. This latter paradox must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span> removed in order that
the myth shall become intelligible.</p>

<p>The eleventh of the <i>Rig-Veda</i> stanzas presents the two dogs as guides
of the soul <span title = "psychopompoi"><b>&#968;&#965;&#967;&#959;&#960;&#972;&#956;&#960;&#959;&#953;</b></span> to heaven: "To thy two four-eyed,
road-guarding, man-beholding watch-dogs entrust him, O King Yama, and
bestow on him prosperity and health."</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3>THE TWO DOGS IN HEAVEN.</h3>

<p>With the change of the abode of the dead from inferno to heaven the two
Cerberi are <i>eo ipso</i> also evicted. That follows of itself, even if we
had not explicit testimony. A legend of the Br&#257;hmana-texts, the Hindu
equivalent of the Talmud, tells repeatedly that there are two dogs <i>in
heaven</i>, and that these two dogs are Yama's dogs. I shall present two
versions of the story, a kind of <span title = "Gigantomachia"><b>&#915;&#953;&#947;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#967;&#943;&#945;</b></span> in order to
establish the equation between the terms "two dogs of Yama," and "two
heavenly dogs."</p>

<p>There were Asuras (demons) named K&#257;lak&#257;njas. They piled up a fire
altar in order to obtain the world of heaven. Man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span> by man they placed a
brick upon it. The god Indra, passing himself off for a Brahmin, put on
a brick for himself. They climbed up to heaven. Indra pulled out his
brick; they tumbled down. And they who tumbled down became spiders; two
flew up, and became the two heavenly dogs." (Br&#257;hmana of the
<i>T&#257;ittir&#299;yas</i> 1. 1. 2.)</p>

<p>"The Asuras (demons) called K&#257;lak&#257;njas piled bricks for an altar,
saying: 'We will ascend to heaven.' Indra, passing himself off for a
Brahmin, came to them; he put on a brick. They at first came near
getting to heaven; then Indra tore out his brick. The Asuras becoming
quite feeble fell down; the two that were uppermost became the dogs of
Yama, those which were lower became spiders." (Br&#257;hmana of the
<i>M&#257;itra</i> 1. 6. 9.)</p>

<p>This theme is so well fixed in the minds of the time that it is
elaborated in a charm to preserve from some kind of injury, addressed to
the mythic figures of the legend:</p>

<p>"Through the air he flies looking down upon all beings: with the majesty
of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span> heavenly dog, with that oblation would we pay homage to thee.</p>

<p>"The three K&#257;lak&#257;njas, that are fixed upon the sky like gods, all
these I have called to help, to render this person free from harm.</p>

<p>"In the waters is thy origin, upon the heavens thy home, in the middle
of the sea, and upon the earth, thy greatness; with the majesty of the
heavenly dog, with that oblation would we pay homage to thee."
(<i>Atharva-Veda</i> vi., 80.)</p>

<p>The single heavenly dog that is described here is of no mean interest.
The passage proves the individual character of each of the two dogs of
Yama; they cannot be a vague pair of heavenly dogs, but must be based
each upon some definite phenomenon in the heavens.</p>

<p>Yet another text, Hiranyake&ccedil;in's book of house-rites, locates the dogs
of Yama, describing them in unmistakable language, in heaven: "The brood
of Saram&#257;, dark beneath and brown, run, looking down upon the sea."
(ii. 7. 2.)</p>

<h3>THE TWO DOGS OF YAMA EXPLAIN THEMSELVES.</h3>

<p>There are not many things in heaven that can be represented as a pair,
coursing across the sky, looking down upon the sea, and having other
related properties. My readers will make a shrewd guess, but I prefer to
let the texts themselves unfold the transparent mystery. The Veda of the
<i>Katha</i> school (xxxvii. 14) says: "These two dogs of Yama, verily, are
day and night," and the Br&#257;hmana of the <i>K&#257;ush&#299;takins</i> (ii. 9)
argues in Talmudic strain: "At eve, when the sun has gone down, before
darkness has set in, one should sacrifice the <i>agnihotra</i>-sacrifice; in
the morning before sunrise, when darkness is dispelled, at that time,
one should sacrifice the <i>agnihotra</i>-sacrifice; at that time the gods
arrive. Therefore (the two dogs of Yama) &Ccedil;y&#257;ma and &Ccedil;abala (the dark
and the spotted) tear to pieces the <i>agnihotra</i> of him that sacrifices
otherwise. &Ccedil;abala is the day; &Ccedil;y&#257;ma is the night. He who sac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>rifices
in the night, his <i>agnihotra</i> &Ccedil;y&#257;ma tears asunder; he who sacrifices
in broad daylight, his <i>agnihotra</i> &Ccedil;abala tears asunder." Even more
drily the two dogs of Yama are correlated with the time-markers of
heaven in a passage of the <i>T&#257;ittir&#299;ya-Veda</i> (v. 7. 19); here
sundry parts of the sacrificial horse are assigned to four cosmic
phenomena in the following order: 1. Sun and moon. 2. &Ccedil;y&#257;ma and
&Ccedil;abala (the two dogs of Yama). 3. Dawn. 4. Evening twilight. So that the
dogs of Yama are sandwiched in between sun and moon on the one side,
dawn and evening twilight on the other. Obviously they are here, either
as a special designation of day and night, or their physical
equivalents, sun and moon. And now the <i>&Ccedil;atapatha-Br&#257;hmana</i> says
explicitly: "The moon verily is the divine dog; he looks down upon the
cattle of the sacrificer." And again a passage in the Kashmir version of
the <i>Atharva-Veda</i> says: "The four-eyed dog (the moon) surveys by night
the sphere of the night."</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span></p>
<h3>SUN AND MOON AS STATIONS ON THE WAY TO SALVATION.</h3>

<p>Even the theosophic Upanishads are compelled to make their way through
this tolerably crude mythology when they come to deal with the passage
of the soul to release from existence and absorption in the universal
Brahma. The human mind does not easily escape some kind of
eschatological topography. The Brahma itself may be devoid of all
properties, universal, pervasive, situated below as well as above, the
one true thing everywhere; still even the Upanishads finally fix upon a
world of Brahma, and that is above, not below, nor elsewhere; hence the
soul must pass the great cosmic potencies that seem to lie on the road
from the sublunary regions to Brahma. The <i>K&#257;ush&#299;taki Upanishad</i>
(1. 2. 3) arranges that all who leave this world first go to the moon,
the moon being the door of the world of light. The moon asks certain
theosophic questions; he alone who can answer them is considered
sufficiently emancipated to advance to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span> world of Brahma. He who
cannot&mdash;alas!&mdash;is born again as worm or as fly; as fish or as fowl; as
lion or as boar; as bull or tiger or man; or as something else&mdash;any old
thing, as we should say&mdash;in this place or in that place, according to
the quality of his works and the degree of his knowledge; that is, in
accordance with the doctrine of <i>Karma</i>. Similarly the <i>M&#257;itri
Upanishad</i> (vi. 38) sketches salvation as follows: When a mortal no
longer approves of wrath, and ponders the true wish, he penetrates the
veil that encloses the Brahma, breaks through the concentric circles of
sun, moon, fire, etc., that occupy the ether. Only then does he behold
the supreme thing that is founded upon its own greatness only. And now
the <i>Ch&#257;ndogya Upanishad</i> (viii. 13) has the same idea, mentioning
both moon and sun by their ancient names and in their capacity as dogs
of Yama. The soul of the aspirant for fusion with Brahma resorts
purgatorio-fashion alternately to &Ccedil;y&#257;ma (the moon-dog) and &Ccedil;abala
(the sun-dog): "From &Ccedil;y&#257;ma (the moon) do I resort to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span> &Ccedil;abala (the
sun); from &Ccedil;abala to &Ccedil;y&#257;ma. Shaking off sin, as a steed shakes off
(the loose hair of) its mane, as the moon frees itself from the maw of
R&#257;hu, the demon of eclipse, casting aside my body, my real self
delivered, do I enter into the uncreated world of Brahma."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3>ANALYSIS OF THE MYTH.</h3>

<p>Hindu mythology is famous for what I should like to hear called arrested
personification, or arrested anthropomorphism. More than elsewhere
mythic figures seem here to cling to the dear memories of their birth
and youth. This is due in part to the unequaled impressiveness of nature
in India; in part to the dogged schematism of the Hindu mind, which
dislikes to let go of any part of a thing from the beginning to end. On
the one hand, their constant, almost too rhythmic resort to nature in
their poetry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span> and on the other, their Ved&#257;nta philosophy, or for
that matter their <i>Ars amatoria</i> (<i>K&#257;ma&ccedil;&#257;stra</i>), the latter worked
out with painstaking and undignified detail, illustrate the two points.
Hence we find here a situation which is familiar enough in the Veda, but
scarcely and rarely exhibited in other mythological fields. Dogs, the
two dogs of Yama are, but yet, too, sun and moon. It is quite surprising
how well the attributes of things so different keep on fitting them both
well enough. The color and brightness of the sun jumps with the fixed
epithet, "spotted," of the sun-dog &Ccedil;abala; the moon-dog is black
(&Ccedil;y&#257;ma or &Ccedil;y&#257;va). Sun and moon, as they move across the sky, are
the natural messengers of Yama, seated on high in the abode of the
blessed, but Yama is after all death, and death hounds us all. Epithets
like "man-beholding," or "guarding the way," suit neutrally both
conceptions. Above all, the earliest statements about Yama's dogs are
relieved of their inconsistencies. On the one hand the exhortation to
the dead to run past the two dogs in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span> order to get to heaven, suits the
idea of the heavenly dogs who are coursing across the sky. On the other
hand, by an easy, though quite contrary, change of mental position, the
same two heavenly dogs are the guides who guard the way and look upon
men favorably; hence they are ordered by Yama to take charge of the dead
and to furnish them such health and prosperity as the shades happen to
have use for. Again, by an equally simple shift of position, sun and
moon move among men as the messengers of death; by night and by day men
perish, while these heavenly bodies alternate in their presence among
men."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Hence a text of the Veda can say in a similar mood: "May Day
and Night procure for us long life" (House-book of &#256;&ccedil;val&#257;yana, ii.
4. 14). Conversely it is a commonplace of the Veda to say that day and
night destroy the lives of men. One text says that, "day and night are
the encircling arms of death" (Br&#257;hmana of the <i>K&#257;ush&#299;takin</i>,
ii. 9). Another,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span> more explicitly, "the year is death; by means of day
and night does it destroy the life of mortals (<i>&Ccedil;atapatha-Br&#257;hmana</i>,
x. 4. 3. 1). He who wishes to be released from the grim grip of day and
night sacrifices (symbolically) white and black rice, and pronounces the
words: "Hail to Day; hail to Night; hail to Release" (Br&#257;hmana of the
<i>T&#257;ittiriya</i>, iii. 1. 6. 2). Who does not remember in this connection
the parable widely current in the Orient, in which two rats, one white,
the other black, gnaw alternately, but without let-up, the plant or tree
of life?<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3>THE CERBERI IN THE NORSE MYTH.</h3>

<p>Norse mythology also contains certain animal pairs which seem to reflect
the two dualities, sun and moon, and day and night. There is here no
certainty as to detail; the Norse myth is advanced and congealed, if not
spurious, as Professor Bugge and his school would have us believe. At
the feet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span> of Odin lie his two wolves, Geri and Freki, "Greedy" and
"Voracious." They hurl themselves across the lands when peace is broken.
Who shall say that they are to be entirely dissociated from Yama's two
dogs of death? The virgin Mengl&ouml;dh sleeps in her wonderful castle on the
mountain called Hyfja, guarded by the two dogs Geri and Gifr, "Greedy"
and "Violent," who take turns in watching; only alternately may they
sleep as they watch the Hyfja mountain. "One sleeps by night, the other
by day, and thus no one may enter" (<i>Fi&ouml;lsvinnsm&acirc;l</i>, 16). It is not
necessary to suppose any direct connection between this fable and the
Vedic myth, but the root of the thought, no matter from how great a
distance it may have come, and how completely it may have been worked
over by the Norse skald, is, after all, alternating sun and moon and
their partners, day and night.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3>CERBERUS IN THE PERSIAN AVESTA.</h3>

<p>No reasonable student of mythology will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span> demand of a myth so clearly
destined for fructification an everlasting virginal inviolateness. From
the start almost the two dogs of Yama are the brood of Saram&#257;. Why?
Saram&#257; is the female messenger of the gods, at the root identical
with Hermes or Hermeias; she is therefore the predestined mother of
those other messengers, the two four-eyed dogs of Yama. And as the
latter are her litter the myth becomes retroactive; she herself is
fancied later on as a four-eyed bitch (<i>Atharva-Veda</i>, iv. 20. 7).
Similarly the epithet "broad-nosed" stands not in need of mythic
interpretation, as soon as it has become a question of life-hunting
dogs. Elusive and vague, I confess, is the persistent and important
attribute "four-eyed." This touch is both old and widespread. The
<i>Avesta</i>, the bible of the ancient Iranians, has reduced the Cerberus
myth to stunted rudiments. In <i>Vendidad</i>, xiii. 8. 9, the killing of
dogs is forbidden, because the soul of the slayer "when passing to the
other world, shall fly amid louder howling and fiercer pursuit than the
sheep does when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span> the wolf rushes upon it in the lofty forest. No soul
will come and meet his departing soul and help it through the howls and
pursuit in the other world; nor will the dogs that keep the Cinvad
bridge (the bridge to paradise) help his departing soul through the
howls and pursuit in the other world." The <i>Avesta</i> also conceives this
dog to be four-eyed. When a man dies, as soon as the soul has parted
from the body, the evil one, the corpse-devil (Druj Nasu), from the
regions of hell, falls upon the dead. Whoever henceforth touches the
corpse becomes unclean, and makes unclean whomsoever he touches. The
devil is expelled from the dead by means of the "look of the dog": a
"four-eyed dog" is brought near the body and is made to look at the
dead; as soon as he has done so the devil flees back to hell
(<i>Vendidad</i>, vii. 7; viii. 41). It is not easy to fetch from a
mythological hell mythological monsters for casual purposes, especially
as men are always engaged in dying upon the earth. Herakles is the only
one who, one single time, performed this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span> notable "stunt." So the
Parsis, being at a loss to find four-eyed dogs, interpret the name as
meaning a dog with two spots over the eyes. Curiously enough the Hindu
scholiasts also regularly interpret the term "four-eyed" in exactly the
same way, "with spots over the eyes." And the Vedic ritual in its turn
has occasion to realize the mythological four-eyed dog in practice. The
horse, at the horse-sacrifice, must take a bath for consecration to the
holy end to which it is put. It must also be guarded against hostile
influences. A low-caste man brings a four-eyed dog&mdash;here obviously the
symbol of the hostile powers&mdash;kills him with a club, and afterwards
places him under the feet of the horse. It is scarcely necessary to
state that this is a dog with spots over his eyes, and that he is a
symbol of Cerberus.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE TERM "FOUR-EYED."</h3>

<p>The epithet "four-eyed" may possibly contain a tentative coagulation of
the two dogs in one. The capacity of the two dogs to see both by day
(the sun) and by night (the moon) may have given the myth a slight start
into the direction of the two-headed Greek Cerberus. But there is the
alternate possibility that four-eyed is but a figure of speech for
"sharp-sighted," especially as I have shown elsewhere that the parallel
expression "to run with four feet" is a Vedic figure of speech for
"swift of foot."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Certainly the god Agni, "Fire," is once in the
<i>Rig-Veda</i> (i. 31. 13) called "four-eyed," which can only mean
"sharp-sighted."</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3>THE DUAL &Ccedil;ABAL&#256;U.</h3>

<p>The two dogs of Yama derive their proper names from their color
epithets. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span> passages above make it clear that &Ccedil;y&#257;ma (rarely
&Ccedil;y&#257;va), "the black," is the moon dog, and that &Ccedil;abala, "the spotted,
or brindled," is the sun dog. In one early passage (<i>Rig-Veda</i>, x. 14.
10) both dogs are named in the dual as &Ccedil;abal&#257;u. But for a certain
Vedic usage one might think that "the two spotted ones" was their
earliest designation. The usage referred to is the eliptic dual: a close
or natural pair, each member of which suggests the other, may be
expressed through the dual of one of them, as when either
<i>m&#257;tar&#257;u</i> or <i>pitar&#257;u</i>, literally, "the two mothers," and "the
two fathers," each mean "the two parents."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> From this we may conclude
that &Ccedil;abal&#257;u means really &Ccedil;abala and &Ccedil;y&#257;ma, and not the two
&Ccedil;abalas, that is, "the two spotted ones."</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3>IS &Ccedil;ABALAS = <span title = "Kerberos">&#922;&#941;&#961;&#946;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;?</span></h3>

<p>More than a hundred years ago the Anglo-Indian Wilford, in the <i>Asiatick
Re</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span><i>searches</i>, iii., page 409, wrote: "Yama, the regent of hell, has two
dogs, according to the Pur&#257;nas; one of them named Cerbura, or varied;
the other Syama, or black." He then compares Cerbura with Kerberos, of
course. The form Cerbura he obtained from his consulting Pandit, who
explained the name &Ccedil;abala by the Sanskrit word <i>karbura</i> "variegated," a
regular gloss of the Hindu scholiasts.</p>

<p>About fifty years later a number of distinguished scholars of the past
generation, Max M&uuml;ller, Albrecht Weber, and Theodor Benfey, compared the
word &Ccedil;abala with Greek <span title = "Kerberos"><b>&#922;&#941;&#961;&#946;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;</b></span> (rarely <span title = "Kerbelos"><b>&#922;&#941;&#961;&#946;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#962;</b></span>),
but, since then, this identification has been assailed in numerous
quarters with some degree of heat, because it suffers from a slight
phonetic difficulty. One need but remember the swift changes which the
name of Apollo passes through in the mouths of the Greeks&mdash;
<span title = "Apollôn"><b>&#913;&#960;&#972;&#955;&#955;&#969;&#957;</b></span>,
<span title = "Apellôn"><b>&#913;&#960;&#941;&#955;&#955;&#969;&#957;</b></span>,
<span title = "Appellôn"><b>&#913;&#960;&#960;&#941;&#955;&#955;&#969;&#957;</b></span>,
<span title = "Apeilôn"><b>&#913;&#960;&#949;&#943;&#955;&#969;&#957;</b></span>,
<span title = "Aploun"><b>&#913;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#957;</b></span><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>&mdash;to realize that it is useless to demand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span> strict phonetic
conservation of mythic proper names. The nominative &Ccedil;abalas, translated
sound for sound into Greek, yields
<span title = "Keberos"><b>&#922;&#949;&#946;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;</b></span>,
<span title = "Kebelos"><b>&#922;&#949;&#946;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#962;</b></span>;
<i>vice versa</i>,
<span title = "Kerberos"><b>&#922;&#941;&#946;&#961;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;</b>?</span>
translated sound for sound into Vedic
Sanskrit yields &Ccedil;albalas, or perhaps, dialectically, &Ccedil;abbalas. It is a
sober view that considers it rather surprising that the two languages
have not manipulated their respective versions of the word so as to
increase still further the phonetic distance between them. Certainly the
burden is now to prove that the identification is to be rejected, and, I
think, that the soundest linguistic science will refuse ultimately to
consider the phonetic discrepancy between the two words as a matter of
serious import.</p>

<p>But whether the names &Ccedil;abalas and Kerberos are identical or not, the
myth itself is the thing. The explanation which we have coaxed step by
step from the texts of the Veda imparts to the myth a definite
character: it is no longer a dark and uncertain touch in the troubled
visions of hell,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span> but an uncommonly lucid treatment of an important
cosmic phenomenon. Sun and moon course across the sky: beyond is the
abode of light and the blessed. The coursers are at one moment regarded
as barring the way to heaven; at another as outposts who may guide the
soul to heaven. In yet another mood, as they constantly, day by day,
look down upon the race of men, dying day by day, they are regarded as
picking daily candidates for the final journey. In due time Yama and his
heaven are degraded to a mere Pluto and hell; then the terrible
character of the two dogs is all that can be left to them. And the two
dogs blend into a unit variously, either a four-eyed Parsi dog, or a
two-headed&mdash;finally a plural-headed&mdash;Kerberos.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3>OTHER DOGS OF HELL.</h3>

<p>The peace of mind of one or the other reader is likely to be disturbed
by the appearance of a hell-dog here and there among peoples outside of
the Indo-European<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span> (Aryan) family. So, e. g., I. G. M&uuml;ller, in his
<i>Geschichte der Americanischen Urreligionen</i>, second edition, p. 88,
mentions a dog who threatens to swallow the souls in their passage of
the river of hell. There was a custom among the Mordwines to put a club
into the coffin with the corpse, to enable him to drive away the
watch-dogs at the gate of the nether world.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The Mordwines, however,
have borrowed much of their mythology from the Iranians. The Hurons and
Iroquois told the early missionaries that after death the soul must
cross a deep and swift river on a bridge formed by a single slender
tree, where it had to defend itself against the attacks of a dog.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> No
sane ethnologist or philologer will insist that all these conceptions
are related <i>genetically</i>, that there is nothing accidental in the
repetition of the idea. The dog is prominent in animal mythology; one of
his func<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>tions is to watch. It is quite possible, nay likely, that a
dog, pure and simple, has strayed occasionally into this sphere of
conceptions without any further organic meaning&mdash;simply as a baying,
hostile watch-dog. But we cannot prove anything by an ignorant <i>non
possumus</i>; the conception <i>may</i>, even if we cannot say <i>must</i>, after all
in each case, have been derived from essentially the same source: the
dead journeying upward to heaven interfered with by a coursing heavenly
body, the sun or the moon, or both. Anyhow, the organic quality of the
Indo-European, or at least the Hindu myth makes it guide and
philosopher. From dual sun and moon coursing across the sky to the two
hell-hounds, each step of development is no less clear than from Zeus
pater, "Father Sky," to breezy Jove, the gentleman about town with his
escapades and amours. To reverse the process, to imagine that the Hindus
started with two visionary dogs and finally identified them with sun and
moon&mdash;that is as easy and natural as it is for a river to flow up the
hill back to its source.</p>

<h3>MAX M&Uuml;LLER'S CERBERUS.</h3>

<p>The rudiment of the present essay in Comparative Mythology was published
by the writer some years ago in a learned journal, under the title, "The
two dogs of Yama in a new role."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> My late lamented friend, Max
M&uuml;ller, the gifted writer who knew best of all men how to rivet the
attention of the cultivated public upon questions of this sort, did me
the honor to notice my proposition in an article in the <i>London Academy</i>
of August 13, 1892 (number 1058, page 134-5), entitled "Professor
Bloomfield's Contributions to the Interpretation of the Veda." In this
article he seems to try to establish a certain similarity between his
conception of the Kerberos myth and my own. This similarity seems to me
to be entirely illusory. Professor M&uuml;ller's own last words on the
subject in the Preface<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span> of his <i>Contributions to the Science of
Mythology</i> (p. xvi.), will make clear the difference between our views.
He identifies, as he always has identified, Kerberos with the Vedic stem
<i>&ccedil;arvara</i>, from which is derived <i>&ccedil;arvar&#299;</i>, "night." To quote his own
words: "The germ of the idea ... must be discovered in that nocturnal
darkness, that <i>&ccedil;&#257;rvaram tamas</i>, which native mythologists in India
had not yet quite forgotten in post-Vedic times." With such a view my
own has not the least point of contact. &Ccedil;abala, the name of one of the
dogs, means "spotted, bright"; it is the name of the sun-dog; it is
quite the opposite of the <i>&ccedil;&#257;rvaram tamas</i>. The name of the moon-dog,
and, by transfer, the dog of the night, is &Ccedil;y&#257;ma or &Ccedil;y&#257;va "black,"
not &Ccedil;abala, nor &Ccedil;arvara. The association of the two dogs with day and
night is the association of sun and moon with their respective diurnal
divisions, and nothing more. Of Cimmerian gloom there can be nothing in
the myth primarily, because it deals at the beginning with heaven, and
not with hell;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span> with an auspicious, and not a gloomy, vision of life
after death.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3>CERBERUS AND COMPARATIVE MYTHOLOGY.</h3>

<p>In conclusion I would draw the attention of those scholars, writers, and
publicists that have declared bankruptcy against the methods and results
of Comparative Mythology to the present attempt to establish an
Indo-European naturalistic myth. I would ask them to consider, in the
light of the Veda, that it is probable that the early notions of future
life turn to the visible heaven with its sun and moon, rather than to
the topographically unstable and elusive caves and gullies that lead to
a wide-gated Hades. In heaven, therefore, and not in hell, is the likely
breeding spot of the Cerberus myth. On the way to heaven there is but
one pair that can have shaped itself reasonably in the minds of
primitive observers into a pair of Cerberi. Sun and moon, the Veda
declares, are the Cerberi. In due time, and by gradual stages, the
heaven myth became a hell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span> myth. The Vedic seers had no Pluto, no Hades,
no Styx, and no Charon; yet they had the pair of dogs. Now when Yama and
his heaven become Pluto and hell, then, and only then, Yama's dogs are
on a plane with the three-headed, or two-headed, Greek Kerberos. Is it
not likely that the chthonic hell visions of the Greeks were also
preceded by heavenly visions, and that Kerberos originally sprang from
heaven? Consider, too, the breadth and the persistence of these ideas,
their simple background, and their natural transition from one feature
to another in the myth of Cerberus; that is, the notions of sun and moon
(day and night) in their relation to the precarious life of man upon the
earth, his death, and his future life. For my part, I do not believe
that the honest critics of the methods and results of Comparative
Mythology, though they have been made justly suspicious by the many
failures in this field, will ever successfully "run past, straightway,
the two four-eyed dogs, the spotted and the dark, the &Ccedil;abal&#257;u, the
brood of Saram&#257;."</p>

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
